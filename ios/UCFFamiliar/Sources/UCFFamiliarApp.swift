// UCF Familiar — the ship's computer as its own app, and nothing else (Ian, 2026-09-04): a
// companion to United Cat Foods that runs against Jeff's PROD world or a dev instance, with
// Apple Intelligence on the device (and Private Cloud Compute) as its brains, so it can stay
// entirely on the iPad, iPhone or Mac. A familiar host is optional: add one to get a pilot
// that flies while the phone sleeps; without one, Felix observes, briefs, advises and talks
// straight from the exchange.
