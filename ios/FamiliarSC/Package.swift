// FamiliarSC — the ship's computer's Apple half (T-237 B2). Pure logic: the ship-store
// reader (persona, captain, automations, the autonomy dial, journal, proposals/approvals,
// holdings, deliveries), the message-window feed, a typed READ-ONLY client for the UCF
// exchange's /v1 wire, the pairing-key parse, the captain-notice policy, and the bridge
// voice — a typed bridge report rendered by a deterministic templated floor, or spoken by
// Apple Intelligence (on-device Foundation Models; Private Cloud Compute on OS 27 behind
// entitlement + consent) and checked against that floor before it is shown. Nothing here
// places an action on the exchange or writes a ship store: approval and the dial are the
// captain's acts, done by the app on the captain's tap, never by the model.
//
// Builds and tests on macOS (`swift test`) with no device, no key and no network. The
// Foundation Models lane compiles against the 27 SDK (this project builds with the newest
// Xcode, period) and degrades to the templated floor at runtime wherever the model is
// unavailable — the floor is the product, the model is the voice.
