// The UCF exchange's /v1 wire, typed and READ-ONLY. Every shape here is pinned by a fixture
// captured from PROD (Tests/Fixtures/wire/*.json). Fields the familiar does not use today
// are left to the decoder to ignore; fields that may be absent are optional — the exchange
// adds keys between content versions and a client that refused a new key would read the
// whole market as empty that day.
//
// ONE method POSTs an action, `file(_:actionId:)`, and only the captain's confirmed act
// reaches it (direct mode's confirm-to-act path): Apple Intelligence
// never places an action on the exchange, and no read path can. Through a host the pilot
// files acts and the captain approves them in the ship store. `ActionAck` is a CLOCK
// (resolvesAtTick), never a verdict — outcomes come from /v1/receipts (trades) and
// /v1/me.freight (freight).
