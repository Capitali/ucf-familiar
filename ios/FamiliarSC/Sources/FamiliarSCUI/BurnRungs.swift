// The burn rungs, ported from crates/whisker/src/doctrine.rs (2161a55): the exchange prices
// four throttles and each is a real trade — time goes as 1/√a and propellant follows the
// rocket equation on a Δv that goes as √a. Standard FIRST, always; economy only when standard
// cannot reach; never up. Under a contract the LOAD's class governs every leg, so the rung
// only reaches the physics on an unbooked voyage — the run to a pump, the merchant carry.
// Kibble Klipper sat three days at titania on 135 of 600 with foxys-diner 168 away at
// standard and 112 away at economy (2026-09-04); nothing was wrong with the tank.
//
// Two figures, deliberately different: the exchange's /v1/route quote is ALWAYS at the
// reference drive (189 mG) whatever the hull flies, so `modelAgrees` checks at 189; the rung's
// own fuel uses the hull's drive × bps, where the hull's drive is `effectiveAccelMilliG` read
// off /v1/me — the one number with wear and fittings already applied. Never derive it.
//
// Wear accrues per leg on departure and lowers the drive; a lower drive means less Δv and LESS
// fuel, so a multi-leg plan priced at the departure drive is conservative on propellant and
// optimistic on time. Any ETA this model implies for a later leg drifts late for that reason.
