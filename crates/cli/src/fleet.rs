//! `ucf-familiar fleet` — the captain's ships, and the pilots that fly them.
//!
//! A captain in the game buys the familiar for a ship they own or lease and hands
//! it a key (today a trading key; tomorrow the co-pilot key the exchange mints with
//! the purchased automation scopes — ucf-exchange#15). PAIRING turns that hand-off
//! into a ship world of its own (the ship's store holds the key, the grants and the
//! journal; the fleet holds only the provisioning record), leased by the fleet's
//! word. UNPAIRING is revocation: the pilot stops, the key is destroyed, the record
//! stays. STATUS reads every ship's own ledger on the wire and books them per
//! captain — earnings POOL within one captain's ships and never across captains
//! (the fleet money boundary, 2026-09-01). RUN keeps one pilot per paired ship
//! alive and, when told to, renews leases before they lapse.
//!
//! The ask, 2026-09-02: "The familiar needs to work in conjunction to a captain in
//! the game who purchased the familiar for their owned or leased ship … we need it
//! all working first" — this is the working half; the in-game purchase and key
//! minting belong to the exchange.
