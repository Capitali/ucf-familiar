//! The outfitting doctrine, pure: what to buy for the hull, and when (2026-09-02:
//! "The loaf has expansion capabilities that should be managed as well. Hold
//! expansion, refrigeration, engine tuning, as well as crew.").
//!
//! The exchange sells three fittings, one of each ever, at any berth (`refit`):
//! `drive-tune` (+15% rated thrust), `hold-extension` (+40 hold), `refrigeration`
//! (in-transit decay of the pilot's own contracted freight halved). Crew are hired
//! by station; the engine relieves wear, the hold speeds handling, the galley
//! props morale; the bridge has no rules in the engine yet. Frames and the lease
//! buyout are the captain's business decisions, not the pilot's.
//!
//! The rules, and the reasoning:
//! - **Never spend the reserve.** A purchase must leave enough cash for
//!   [`RESERVE_DAYS`] of the ship's fixed daily charges (mortgage payment and lease
//!   service) plus a tank of fuel — the charges are swept whether or not she earns.
//! - **Refrigeration only on evidence.** Deliveries pay a fixed company share
//!   whatever the cargo (the 85% KK II sees is not decay). Refrigeration is bought
//!   when the ship's OWN delivery record shows perishable loads paying a smaller
//!   share than durable ones by a margin — the fitting halves exactly that loss.
//! - **Drive-tune before hold-extension.** Thrust shortens every leg (time scales
//!   with the square root of acceleration) and widens the pickup window; hold
//!   only matters when loads or positions are hold-bound.
//! - **Crew after title.** On a leased hull the yard repairs wear for nothing, so
//!   an engineer's job is already done for free; wages are a recurring cost.
