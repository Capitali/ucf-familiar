//! **whisker** — the ship world's pilot. Its doctrine was learned live, flying a real
//! hull, from 2026-08-31 on; the comments carry the incidents that taught it.
//!
//! A cat judges every clearance by its whiskers before committing its body. This crate
//! is that judgment for a United Cat Foods hull: a PURE decision doctrine (`doctrine`)
//! that owns no socket, wrapped by a runner (`src/main.rs`) that reads the SHIP's own
//! store and nothing else.
//!
//! The partition is the whole point: everything here — key, journal, lease, learned
//! prices — lives in the ship's data dir. The fleet appears only as the ISSUER of the
//! lease the runner verifies before any consequential act, via the public identity the
//! commissioning ceremony wrote into the ship store. No record outside the ship's own
//! store is ever read, and no game fact ever leaves except as a payload-free attention
//! notice.
//!
//! **Automation is a named, sellable capability** (decided 2026-08-31: driving a ship by
//! familiar is pay-per-feature — a captain buys automations the way they hire crew or
//! add refrigeration). The doctrine therefore tags every decision with the [`Automation`]
//! it exercises, and the runner refuses a decision whose automation the ship does not
//! hold. Today only [`Automation::Freight`] is implemented; the rest of the enum is the
//! roadmap (united-cat-foods-metal#61), present so the gate exists before the features.
