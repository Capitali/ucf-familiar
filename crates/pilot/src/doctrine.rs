//! The pilot's judgment, pure. No socket, no clock, no store — facts in, one
//! [`Decision`] out — so every rule learned the hard way is pinned by a test that
//! needs no world to run against.
//!
//! The rules and where each was learned (LOCAL world, 2026-08-31):
//! - **One intent at a time, and the fold is the truth.** An accepted action can take
//!   several folds to SHOW; re-filing the same intent is how the ship zigzagged its
//!   tank empty. (The caller owns dedupe/pacing; decide() is deliberately stateless.)
//! - **Fuel is planned before a booking, not discovered after.** The exchange's own
//!   router prices propellant per leg; a load is takeable only if the tank covers
//!   deadhead + haul with reserve, or the origin sells fuel and the tank covers the
//!   deadhead with the CAPACITY covering the haul.
//! - **Pump fuel over tanker fuel.** Top up whenever berthed at a seller below 90%.
//! - **PAWS is the floor, not a plan.** Under 5% the only right move is the tanker —
//!   double price and a wait beats a drifting hull (confirmed by the owner from PROD).
//! - **No pump at this berth is a routing fact**, learned when six refuels in a row
//!   were rejected at a cold store: divert to the cheapest-to-reach seller.
