//! The autonomy dial, pure: how much of each control surface the captain has handed
//! to the ship's computer. The asked-for shape (2026-09-03): a message window giving
//! advice the captain may follow or not; the ability to simply allow a captain-authorized
//! command and have the ship proceed as KK II already does; and granular configuration of
//! autonomy per control-surface category and family.
//!
//! Every doctrine decision has one of three fates, chosen per control surface:
//! **advise** (say what it would do, do nothing), **confirm** (propose, act only on the
//! captain's yes within a fold), **auto** (act and journal). The dial is `autonomy.json`
//! in the ship store: `{"navigation.course": "auto", "market": "confirm", "*": "auto"}` —
//! a category, a family, or `*`, most specific wins. Absent means auto for everything
//! the captain has bought (KK II today). The grant model stands beneath it: an
//! automation not bought is not on the dial at all.
