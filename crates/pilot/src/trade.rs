//! The merchant doctrine, pure. Buy a good where it is cheap, carry it, sell it
//! where it is dear — arbitrage across the moving map, the trader's complement to
//! the freight hauler (2026-09-01: "I want KK II to trade as well as haul").
//!
//! No socket, no clock, no store — market facts + what we hold, in; one
//! [`TradeDecision`], out. Every money rule is pinned by a test, because a trader
//! that is wrong about profit loses ℳ silently where a hauler that is wrong merely
//! sits still.
//!
//! What the first LOCAL soak taught (2026-09-01, litter-clay L-run, tranquility →
//! io-slagworks), each now a rule:
//! - **The exchange enforces a MINIMUM HOLD on bought goods** (`minHoldTicks`, a
//!   day of ticks: 48 minutes on LOCAL, 14 hours on PROD). A sell before the clock
//!   is a deterministic rejection — "minimum hold (sellable at tick N)" — not an
//!   error. So a position is not flipped; it RIDES under freight for a day and is
//!   sold at whatever dear berth the hauls pass afterwards. The clock re-arms on
//!   every further buy of the same good, so stacking is never done.
//! - **One position at a time.** The soak stacked four ore buys in four folds,
//!   halving the spare hold each time, because nothing said not to. A second
//!   position also re-arms the first's clock.
//! - **The hold is the truth, not our book.** The acked sell that the fold refused
//!   left 60 units in the hold and zero in the book. The book is reconciled against
//!   `/v1/me.cargo` every fold: refused sells restore, partial fills reduce, goods
//!   we do not remember are adopted at a conservative basis.
//! - **Sell where the lot is worth most from HERE, not where it stops hurting.**
//!   What a lot cost is spent and casts no vote: the question is only whether the
//!   counter in front of us beats the dearest berth on the map net of the fuel to
//!   reach it, the spoilage on the way, and what the hull costs to keep while it
//!   travels. A loss taken to free a hold for better work is a good trade, and a
//!   position held for the dignity of its purchase price is neither dignified nor
//!   a position. Basis returns as the fallback in exactly one case: a map that
//!   says nothing about the good, where what we paid is the only reference left.
//!
//! The disposition this doctrine is meant to have (the owner's word, 2026-09-04) is
//! acquisitive and unsentimental — expansion as the objective, opportunity
//! weighed on instinct and arithmetic together, information treated as the thing
//! that pays, and no attachment whatsoever to a cargo that has stopped earning.
//! It is a posture, not a rulebook, and nothing here should be read as a number
//! to be obeyed rather than a judgement to be made.
//! - **Buy conservatively.** Real ask in; target MID minus a haircut (spread, tax,
//!   drift) out; margin floors per unit AND in total, and the total must clear the
//!   fuel a dedicated carry would burn — the litter-clay run cleared its unit margin
//!   and still lost ℳ to fuel.
//! - **Small positions; never below the cash floor; only reachable, fuelable
//!   buyers**, asked of the router lazily best-payer-first (each question is a
//!   `/v1/route` call on the ship's one rate-limited key).
