//! The supply chain, read as arithmetic (2026-09-02: "our plans looking forward
//! should utilize this information in p&L maximization routines").
//!
//! The exchange already serves the whole production graph: `/v1/reference`
//! carries every station's recipes (inputs, outputs, ticks per cycle) and every
//! good's decay; the quotes whisker already reads carry each shelf's live stock,
//! capacity, and equilibrium. This module turns those into the two numbers a
//! forward plan wants:
//!
//! - **runway** — how many ticks a works can keep eating a given input before
//!   its shelf runs dry (a shrinking runway is a bid that must rise: feed it);
//! - **headroom** — how many ticks its output shelf can keep filling before it
//!   hits capacity (a shrinking headroom is an ask that must fall: lift it).
//!
//! HONESTY BOUND, stated once and carried in the type: the wire does not serve
//! line UTILIZATION (the works screen's "2/10"), so every rate here assumes the
//! lines run FULL. Runway is therefore a LOWER bound and headroom is a lower
//! bound too — the works cannot eat faster or fill faster than this. The live
//! corrective is the shelf's own stock-vs-equilibrium pressure, which the
//! quotes serve and the merchant already prices. If the exchange ever exposes
//! utilization, `Flow::rate_per_kilotick` is where it lands.
//!
//! Pure: no socket, no clock. The runner hands in parsed reference/quote JSON;
//! fixtures hand in the same shapes. Integer arithmetic throughout, engine
//! style — rates are units per 1,000 ticks (a "kilotick") so short cycles keep
//! precision without floats.

// it takes effect and the tick it expires. The exchange's author on the route:
// "Reading the board and moving before `effectiveAtTick` is the entire information
// game; the lead time is the point."
//
// What a headline MEANS is public knowledge: the exchange's content pack ships
// the deck (`Content/market/events.json`, ucf-exchange), every card a headline
// with its effect — a production or consumption multiplier on one station×good,
// a spread at one berth, a lane's cost — plus lead, duration and the odds it
// fires. The pilot carries a copy of the deck (`content/ucf-events.json`, refreshed
// from the exchange's pack) and reads the feed against it, so a
// "third press recommissioned at Tranquility" is a kibble-loaf shelf filling at
// 150% for the next fifty ticks, and a "production hold at Cannery Row" is a
// starving buyer downstream two ticks before the counter shows it.
//
// NOT read, on purpose: `/v1/events`, the overwatch route that publishes the
// resolved coin (`willFire`) and the exact magnitude. PROD answers a player key
// on it (2026-09-15) — api.md calls that route "the sharpest edge of the scope
// trap: a player reading this has no information game left to play". The
// familiar plays the game as designed, from the prior; closing that leak is the
// exchange's business, and it has been reported there.
