//! **The persona seam** — one soul, many voices.
//!
//! A computer's character used to be compiled in: roughly eight inline framings — "You are a
//! factory whose only purpose is to serve …" — living as format strings wherever a line got
//! rendered, so the voice could not be changed without a build. This module ends that: the
//! role phrase is data, loaded per data dir, defaulting to those same words byte-for-byte.
//!
//! **What a persona may never do.** It changes the mask, never the authority. The fixed
//! voice, the boundary gates and the language of refusal sit outside a persona's reach and
//! are always rendered *before* anything from here — a hostile or merely enthusiastic
//! `persona.json` can change tone and cannot touch law. And a costume grants capability over
//! nothing: no gate opens here.
//!
//! **The world partition is the data dir.** A ship (Purr aboard a hull) is a separate data
//! dir with its own `persona.json`, its own declared surfaces and its own store, so one
//! ship's computer cannot inherit another's facts by construction rather than by filter.
