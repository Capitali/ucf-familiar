//! # Worlds are stores
//!
//! A ship world — one hull's UCF instance, or any future fiction — is its OWN STORE: its
//! own data dir, its own keys, its own boundary lease, its own lifetime. No ordinary
//! truth-bearing record anywhere carries a `world` discriminator, because a filter on a
//! shared store is an exclusion that eventually acquires one forgotten reader; a store the
//! fleet holds no handle to cannot be read by construction.
//!
//! This crate is the partition made literal, and only the partition:
//!
//! - [`instance`] — the fleet's minimal `WorldInstance` provisioning record: a record of a
//!   real software relationship (pubkey, label, commissioner, endpoint, lifecycle, grant
//!   epoch), never a copy of the ship world or a dossier of play.
//! - [`bridge`] — the narrow, typed crossings. Outward: `AttentionNotice`. Inward:
//!   exactly the human control-plane acts. A crossing is an envelope with provenance,
//!   never a record; what the fleet keeps of one is a RECEIPT — authorship, time,
//!   delivery — never the payload.
//! - [`lease`] — the signed, expiring projection of the one human-owned boundary. A ship
//!   owns no independently editable boundary; a stale, malformed, or missing lease fails
//!   closed.
//!
//! What this crate deliberately does not do: open any gate, ingest any game datum, run
//! any ship cadence.
