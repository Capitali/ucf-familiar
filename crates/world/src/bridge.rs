//! The narrow bridge. Crossings are typed envelopes carrying provenance — never records,
//! never paths.
//!
//! Outward (ship → fleet): [`AttentionNotice`]. What the fleet keeps of one is a
//! [`BridgeReceipt`] — instance, event id, kind, time. A receipt is citable for
//! "commissioned ship X reported low stores at T" (authorship, time, delivery are real
//! events); the PAYLOAD never becomes truth on the fleet's side, never touches a theory,
//! dossier, presence, capacity, or service signal. The receipt type cannot carry the
//! payload, which is how that stays true without a discipline anyone has to remember.
//!
//! Inward (fleet → ship): exactly the human acts that create and end the relationship —
//! [`ControlEnvelope`]. The decoder refuses anything else; an observation shaped like an
//! envelope fails to parse. A fresh ship is unaware of the fleet; it is not unrevocable.
