//! The signed, expiring boundary projection.
//!
//! Purr owns no independently editable boundary. Three layers: the ONE human-owned root
//! boundary; this lease — a signed projection of it a ship process may hold; and
//! ship-local per-capability grants that can only narrow.
//! Stale, malformed, wrongly-signed, or missing → every consequential call fails closed.
//!
//! The signature covers the exact serialized lease bytes, carried verbatim — no
//! canonicalization step to disagree about (the 1-ULP longitude lesson, 2026-08-13).
